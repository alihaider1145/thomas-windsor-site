  // ─── About Page Content ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  aboutPhilosophy: {
    paragraph1:
      "Artists paint ideas, not things. This simple truth guides every brushstroke in my studio. I believe anyone can paint—what matters isn't technical skill, but the ideas you bring to the canvas.",
    paragraph2:
      "Painting is my way of understanding life and discovering happiness. It's not about creating perfect landscapes; it's about exploring what those landscapes mean, what they reveal about the world and about myself.",
    paragraph3:
      "AI can't enjoy making art. That's why I paint—even if nothing ever sells. The act of painting, the process itself, is where the value lives. Each of my paintings represents a moment of presence, a conversation with myself, a meditation on what it means to be alive.",
  },

  aboutYoutubeSeries:
    "It is called Painting Therapy because it is my Painting Therapy. This is a place for me to express my feelings, my thoughts. Life is always changing. That's why, we always need to be aware of what's happening internally. Being there, is being awake.",

  aboutInvitation: {
    paragraph1:
      "This isn't just my journey—it's an invitation for you to follow along, paint alongside me, or embark on your own creative exploration. Every week, I share a new episode where I paint and reflect. Whether you pick up a brush yourself or simply watch, you're part of this process.",
    paragraph2:
      'Join me in celebrating nature, exploring ideas, and discovering what painting can teach us about ourselves.',
